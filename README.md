# School-work-Cplusplus
A short list of files that I made for school projects. They comprise a series of projects highlighting some of the many container structures in object-oriented programming (e.g. linked lists, tree maps, and stacks &amp; queues). 
Some of them were completed with a tester file, which are included in a separate folder.
